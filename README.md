**Project Title:** QSAR Study of 9,10-Dihydrophenanthrene Derivatives as SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro Inhibitors

**Description:** <br />
This work explores the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene derivatives as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzyme, a key target for COVID-19 treatment. The study employs advanced computational tools and statistical modeling techniques to predict inhibitory activity of the chemical structures. <br />
This project was carried out with academic purposes as a final project for the Drug Design MSc course at Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran, delivered in Spring 2022 semester.

**Key Features:** <br />
  • Dataset Preparation: Compiled from a peer-reviewed study [1], including molecular descriptors generated using DRAGON and HyperChem softwares from a total of 47 molecules. <br />
  • Preprocessing: Data filtering, correlation analysis, and scaling were performed to ensure model robustness.

**Model Development:** <br />
  • Linear Models: Stepwise MLR, PCR, GAMLR, PLS, and GAPLS. <br />
  • Nonlinear Models: BRANN, GA-MLR-ANN, GAPLS-ANN, VIP-PLS-ANN, BRGNN, and MARS. <br />
  • Evaluation Metrics: R² and RMSE values used for model comparison, including cross-validation approaches such as Leave-One-Out and Monte Carlo. 

**Key Results:** <br />
  • The GAPLS model achieved the highest R²(CV) of 0.8183 among linear models. <br />
  • The BRGNN model excelled among nonlinear methods with R²(CV) = 0.88534.

**Technologies & Libraries:** <br />
  • Software: HyperChem, DRAGON, and MATLAB. <br />
  • Libraries: libPLS, ARESLab.

**How to Use:** <br />
  • Clone the repository and load the provided dataset. <br />
  • Execute preprocessing scripts. <br />
  • Run the modeling scripts to generate results.
